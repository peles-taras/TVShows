                  right?â [I was like,] âNo.â Heâs like, âOh,â and then he just walks away. And I run into the production office
                  , and Iâm like, âWhereâs the script?!â And theyâre like, âItâs not available yet,â and Iâm like, âPlease,
                   god, tell me.â And then I read it and I was alive still.â

                Succession loves a good literary reference, and the recent reveal of the series finale title has given\s
                fans another allusion to interpret. Eagle-eyed listings watchers have revealed that the  title for the\s
                last episode,  set to air May 28, will be "With Open Eyes.â

                Like every other Succession season finale before it, the Season 4 finale takes its name from the poem\s
                "Dream Song 29," by John Berryman, originally published in 1964.

                Season 1 ended with "Nobody Is Ever Missing,â season 2 followed that with "This Is Not For Tears,â\s
                and season 3 used "All the Bells Say." The title phrases appear out of order and non-consecutively\s
                in the poem, but taken together offer clues to the kind of tone Succession creator Jesse Armstrong has\s
                been trying to create  over these 40-plus hours of television. ("With Open Eyes" will also apparently\s
                run an hour and half, a supersized farewell to the Roys that would mark the showâs longest episode).\s

                The Berryman invocation is a dark one. Berryman, a contemporary of Sylvia Plath, was tormented by the\s
                death of his father, who shot himself when Berryman was 12. Berryman himself would later jump to\s
                his own death off of the Washington Avenue Bridge in Minnesota in 1972.

                "To me he's the darkest of that generation of poets," Mount Holyoke English professor emeritus\s
                Christopher Benfey tells me. âThere's just a kind of gothic darkness throughout his work that obviously\s
                has continued to keep him on the popular culture map.â

                "Dream Song 29" is part of a cycle of poems that won Berryman the Pulitzer Prize in 1965. In it,\s
                Berryman's recurring character of Henryâ a sort of "dream persona" for Berrymanâthinks he may have\s
                murdered someone, but didn't. Applied to the context of Succession, there's an obvious analogy to\s
                Kendall's vehicular manslaughter incident involving the waiter at Shiv's wedding in the season 1 finale.

                While Armstrong is generally not one for explaining his thought processes, asked about "Dream Song 29"\s
                following the season 2 finale, he told Vulture that the poem "has a terrifying sense of that feeling\s
                Kendall has at the end of the last season, wondering if something could have happened. In Berrymanâs\s
                poemâs case, in the end, [a death] hasnât happened. But it has happened to Kendall."\s

                Benfey, a Succession watcher himself,  immediately picked up on the  "Nobody Is Ever Missing" parallel.
                 "I can see why somebody with a slight English major temperament might pick that line," he says.

                Benfry further speculates that while the season 1 title reference was Succession's most literal, the
                 Berryman allusions growing more abstract as the title tradition continued.

                Still, thereâs reason to think "With Open Eyes" could offer clues about the  show's conclusion.\s

                In context, Berryman writes of Henry:

                "And there is another thing he has in mind

                like a grave Sienese face a thousand years

                would fail to blur the still profiled reproach of.  Ghastly,

                with open eyes, he attends, blind."

                Asked for his analysis, Benfey points to Berryman's echoes of Oedipus Rex, who blinds himself when he\s
                realizes he has killed his father and married his mother, and King Lear's Earl of Gloucester, who\s
                loses his eyes in Lear's daughter Regan's plot for power. Both sagas, obviously, involve major daddy\s
                issues. The DNA of Lear especially courses through Succession, as the ultimate story of a powerful old\s
                manâs grasping children picking  at his legacy.

                âWith Open Eyesâ works equally well, Benfey figures, as a nod to all the gaffes and fumbles the Roy\s
                children make as they grapple for control over Waystar Royco. "It seems to describe our kids pretty\s
                well," Benfey says. âTheir eyes are wide open and they are blind.â

                Benfey, for his part, likes that Succession doesn't hit you over the head with its intellectual\s
                bonafides, instead leaving them as bonus fodder  for those in the know. "It's a show that is informed
                 by literature without showing it off," he says. âBut it does tend to reward a deeper reading.â""");

                 Late last month, it was reported that Severance season 2 was experiencing significant delays.\s
                 Showrunners Dan Erickson and Mark Friedman allegedly had a falling out during the production of season

                  recruiting House of Cards creator Beau Willimon to finish the season.

                Yellowstone star Kevin Costner is officially exiting the hit series. The show, which was created by Taylor Sheridan,\s
                follows the Dutton family as they protect their land, the Yellowstone Dutton Ranch, from various interested parties.\s
                Throughout the series, Costner's character John Dutton III has had a central role as the patriarch of the family,
                 but rumors swirling around a behind-the-scenes falling-out between Costner and Sheridan have led to speculation that he
                  would not be returning after season 5, which is airing its second half later this year after a hiatus.
                                          On Wednesday, ET Online officially confirmed that Costner will not be returning after Yellowstone\s
                                          season 5. It has also not yet been confirmed when the cast and crew will reunite to shoot the\s
                                          impending final six episodes of the season. It is currently unknown how this announcement will

                                           The source of the behind-the-scenes controversy is allegedly a disagreement between Costner
                                            and Sheridan about the star's level of involvement as part of the Yellowstone cast in the\s
                                            final episodes of season 5. Costner's involvement in another Western project, Horizon, has\s
                                            reportedly delayed the return of the series. The four-hour Western epic, which Costner is\s
                                            directing, is being shot in two parts.

                                          Over the past few weeks, the signs have been increasingly pointing toward Costner severing ties\s
                                          with Yellowstone. One of the biggest signs of backstage turmoil was the fact that the Yellowstone\s
                                          panel at PaleyFest was abruptly canceled. It was also recently announced that Costner was resuming

                                             - to keep the story of the Dutton family going.""");
